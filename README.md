# opencode-cursor-oauth

## Disclaimer

> [!NOTE]
> This project is a **fork** of [ephraimduncan/opencode-cursor](https://github.com/ephraimduncan/opencode-cursor). Upstream may differ in behavior, features, or maintenance; treat this repository as its own line of development.

## What it does

This is an [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) plugin that lets you use **Cursor cloud models** (Claude, GPT, Gemini, and whatever your Cursor account exposes) from inside OpenCode.

- **OAuth login** to Cursor in the browser
- **Model discovery** — loads the models available to your Cursor account
- **Local OpenAI-compatible proxy** — translates OpenCode’s requests to Cursor’s gRPC API
- **Token refresh** — refreshes access tokens so sessions keep working

There are **no extra runtime requirements** beyond what OpenCode already needs: you do not install Node, Python, or Docker separately for this plugin. Enable it in OpenCode’s config and complete login in the UI.

This package targets the OpenCode `1.3.4+` plugin system and ships a dedicated server plugin entrypoint for modern OpenCode releases.

## Install

Install the plugin package with OpenCode:

```bash
opencode plugin @playwo/opencode-cursor-oauth
```

Or add the package to your OpenCode configuration manually (for example `opencode.json`):

```json
{
  "plugin": ["@playwo/opencode-cursor-oauth"]
}
```

OpenCode `1.3.4+` can discover this package as a server plugin automatically. You need **OpenCode 1.3.4+** and a **Cursor account** with API/model access.

## Connect auth and use it

1. Start OpenCode with the plugin enabled.
2. Open **Settings → Providers → Cursor** (wording may vary slightly by OpenCode version).
3. Choose **Login** (or equivalent) and complete **OAuth** in the browser when prompted.
4. After login, pick a Cursor-backed model from the model list and use OpenCode as usual.

If something fails, check that you are signed into the correct Cursor account and that your plan includes the models you expect.

## Compatibility Notes

Cursor is not a raw model endpoint like the others supported in Opencode. It brings its own system prompt tools and mechanics.
This plugin does try its best to make mcps, skills etc installed in Opencode work in Cursor.

There are some issues with Cursors system prompt in this environment tho. Cursor adds various tools to the agent which opencode does not have, hence when the agent calls these they will be rejected which can sometimes lead to the agent no longer responding. Am still looking for a way to fix this, till then when the agent stops responding for a while interrupt it and tell it to continue again.

## Stability and issues

This integration can be **buggy** or break when Cursor or OpenCode change their APIs or UI.
